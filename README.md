# Singing Control For Game
Some may think that a simple keyboard and mouse are the best controls for PC games, I beg to differ. Introducing singing controls for a video game. 

### The game
Basic top down on rails shooter. Think of a bad Galaga.

### The controls
You shot projectiles to take down blocks that are coming at you. To shoot towards the left, sing low. To shoot towards the right, sing high. 

### How does it work?
Audio processing and fast fourier transforms. 
By recording audio, I can convert the information from the time domain into the frequency domain. This is then used in conjunction with Unity to generate a simple video game.
